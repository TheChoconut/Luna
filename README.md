Luna: The Moonlight launcher for Kodi - modified by stickman89
See thread at: https://discourse.coreelec.org/t/unofficial-moonlight-embedded

## Installation
- Download from [release page](https://github.com/TheChoconut/luna/releases)
- Copy to your OSMC installation or use a network share
- In Kodi: Settings > Addons > Install from zip file
- Before first starting the addon, you must enter at least the IP of the GameStream host in the addon settings. 

## Features
- GameStream Host Pairing can be done from within Luna
- Controller Mapping can be done there too (that's somewhat buggy though, at times I need to restart xboxdrv on my Pi before it works. Not sure if this is Luna or Moonlight ...)
- Dynamic Game Library
- the above allows for starting of specific games
- extensive configuration which supports nearly all of moonlight-embedded's launch options
- Game View similar to Kodi's movie view (cover art / fanart support)
- [NEW]Now supports Kodi interface
- [NEW]New interface icons
- [NEW]Resume Support
- [NEW]Quit running game
- [NEW]Zerotier Support - (install via Entware)

## Issues
- Controller Mapping sometimes not working
- Please keep in mind that Luna - while I guess it's working pretty good right now - is still alpha, so don't expect it to work perfectly
